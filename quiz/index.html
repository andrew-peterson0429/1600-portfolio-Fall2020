  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Old Gregg is a fictional merman character from the British comedy television series The Mighty Boosh, who has green skin, webbed hands, seaweed hair and female genitalia.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Origin</h2>
  <p>On August 23rd, 2005, The Mighty Boosh episode "The Legend of Old Gregg" aired on the United Kingdom-based television network BBC. In the episode, the character Howard (played by Julian Barratt) accidentally pulls a merman named Old Gregg (played by Noel Fielding) out of the water, who flashes Howard his female genitalia and takes him to his cave. After Howard regains consciousness, Old Gregg pressures Howard into staying and tells the story of "The Funk," an alien creature responsible for the rise of funk music.</p>
